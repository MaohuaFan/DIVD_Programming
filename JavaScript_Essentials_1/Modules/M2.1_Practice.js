// Question 1: Write a code that will create variables and 
    // initialize them with values of Boolean, Number, BigInt, String, 
    // and undefined types using (when possible) literals and constructor functions.






// Question 2: Print all values and all types of those values using console.log.
    // Try to use string interpolation to display the value and type at the same time 
    // with a single console.log call, e.g. in the following form: 1000 [number].



// Question 3: Carry out a chain of conversions: create a Boolean from a BigInt created 
    // from a Number that was created from a String. Start with the value "1234". Is it possible?


// Question 4: Try adding two values of the same type and check the result type. Try it for all primitive types.


// Question 5: Try adding two values of different types and check the results.



// Question 6: Try to modify the line const str1 = 42 + "1"; to get the result 43 (without removing the quotes around 1).
