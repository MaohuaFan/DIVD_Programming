// Exercise 1: Write a script that will ask the user to input a number.
// Display the message "Bingo!" when the number is greater than 90 but less than 110, 
// otherwise display the message: "Miss". Use the if statement.



// Exercise 2: Rewrite the code from the previous task, replacing if with a ternary conditional operator.



// Exercise 3: Write a simple calculator application. Ask the user for the following input, one by one: 
// two numbers and a character representing a mathematical operation, one of "+", "-", "*", "/". 
// If the user input is valid, calculate the result and show it to the user. If the user input is invalid, 
// display a message that informs the user that an error has occurred.

// Remember that the value returned by the prompt function is of the type string. 
// You can use the Number.isNaN method to check if you get the correct number after conversion. 
// For example, calling Number.isNaN(10) will return false, while Number.isNaN(NaN) will return true.
